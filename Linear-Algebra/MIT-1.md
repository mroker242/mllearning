# MIT Lecture 1

This lecture is the first introduction to the course. At the onset we look at two equations in a system of equations:

```
2x - y = 0
-x + 2y = 3

```
### Row Picture


There are different ways to solve this equation. If we solve it algebraically with the [elimination method](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/algebra/systems-of-linear-equations/modal/v/identifying-equivalent-systems-of-equations), we get ```[1,2]``` or that ```x = 1 , y = 2 ```.

You can also solve it by 


### Column Picture

```
x[2] y[-1].  =[0]
 [1]. [2].     [3]

```

This equation is asking for what (linear combination) of ```x``` and ```y``` do you need to find or solve to  ```0``` and ```3```.


So, if you add column 2```[-1,2]``` to column 1```[2,1]``` you will get ```[0,3]```. 

This is the primary understanding of linear combinations which is extremely important.

Important Question: Can any linear combination solve any b? Yes, except for if the columns end up in the same plane.
