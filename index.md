# Curriculum


This curriculum is to learn Machine Learning and is adapted from Siraj Raval. We will be learning with three topics of Math,
Machine Learning, Deep Learning.


## Math

Math as identified by Siraj will be broken up into three topics.

- Linear Algebra
	- [3bluebrown](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNk_zzaMoSs&list=PLZHQObOWTQDPD3MizzM2xVFitgF8hE_ab) is an excellent youtube series that will give you an overall concept of linear algebra.
	- [Kahn Academy](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/linear-algebra/) is a another great resource that will help you with solving linear equations.
	- [MIT Open Courseware for Linear Algebra](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/mathematics/18-06-linear-algebra-spring-2010/readings/) is another excellent resource that will cover up everything you need in this field.
- Probability and Statistics
- Calculus
- Algorithms
